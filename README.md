## Building REST services with Spring

REST has quickly become the de-facto standard for building web services on the web because they’re easy to build and easy to consume.

There’s a much larger discussion to be had about how REST fits in the world of microservices, but - for this tutorial - let’s just look at building RESTful services.

Why REST? REST In Practice proffers, to borrow Martin Fowler’s phrasing, "the notion that the web is an existence proof of a massively scalable distributed system that works really well, and we can take ideas from that to build integrated systems more easily." I think that’s a pretty good reason: REST embraces the precepts of the web itself, and embraces its architecture, benefits and all.

What benefits? Principally all those that come for free with HTTP as a platform itself. Application security (encryption and authentication) are known quantities today for which there are known solutions. Caching is built into the protocol. Service routing, through DNS, is a resilient and well-known system already ubiquitously support.

REST, however ubiquitous, is not a standard, per se, but an approach, a style, a constraint on the HTTP protocol. Its implementation may vary in style, approach. As an API consumer this can be a frustrating experience. The quality of REST services varies wildly.
